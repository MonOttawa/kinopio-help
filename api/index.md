The Kinopio API is used to find, save, and update the spaces of signed up users. You can use it to make cool things too.

# Authentication

Kinopio uses token-based authentication using your user `apiKey`. The easiest way to get your apiKey is by entering `JSON.parse(localStorage.user).apiKey` in your browser console on [kinopio.club](http://kinopio.club).

Use your apiKey in the `Authorization` header of each request.

> ðŸ™ˆ Your API key carries the same privileges as your user account, so be sure to keep it secret!

(For testing, you can also use a query string (`?apiKey=`) but this is less secure and not recommended)

# Rate Limits

The API is limited to 5 requests per second. If you exceed this rate, you will receive a 429 status code and will need to wait 30 seconds before subsequent requests will succeed.

# Routes

<a name="all"></a>
<h2 class="all">All</h2>

[https://api.kinopio.club](https://api.kinopio.club) is the base path for all routes

Method | Name | Description | Auth
--- | --- | --- | ---
`GET` | <code class="all">/</code> | tells you if the api is online | None


<a name="users"></a>
<h2 class="users">Users</h2>

Users are representations of any account on Kinopio. Users are created by the server when they sign up.

Routes with Auth as `apiKey` mean that the Authorization header apiKey must match the requested user.
