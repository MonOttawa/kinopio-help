# Inviting Collaborators to a Space

Invite Collaborators to give them edit access to the contents of your space. Inviting is especially useful for working together on `Private` spaces, but you can do it with any privacy setting.

You should think of collaborators as people you fully trust because they'll be able to edit and remove almost everything in a space.

- For collaborating with the world, or with people you don't fully trust, consider changing your space privacy to `Open` and sharing the normal url instead. That way they'll only be able to add cards and edit what they've created.

Send someone a collaborator invite by copying the url found in `Spaces → Invite Collaborators`

[img share → invite]

Collaborators can:

- Create, move, remove and edit all cards and connections
- Invite other collaborators
- Remove other collaborators

But collaborators cannot:

- Remove the space
- Rename the space
- Remove the creator of the space from it
