Hi, my name is Pirijan and I make Kinopio.

I went to school for biology, then I was a construction worker, then an urban planner. Now I'm a designer and engineer.

Before Kinopio, I was the co-creator of Glitch.com, where I designed and built its original user interfaces.

You can read my blog at [pketh.org](http://pketh.org), or follow me on Twitter [@pketh](http://twitter.com/pketh)

I hope you enjoy using Kinopio and find it useful,

xoxo
