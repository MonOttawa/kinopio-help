Hi, my name is Pirijan and I make Kinopio,

I was born in Germany, grew up in Canada, and now live in Brooklyn, NY.

I went to school for biology and urban design. I've also had a lot of jobs:

- Cashier at a pharmacy
- Waiter/bartender
- Construction worker
- Intern at a government thinktank
- Illustrator
- Designer
- Engineer

Before Kinopio, I was the co-creator of Glitch.com, where I designed and built its original user interfaces. I believe in software that's designed by artists, and built by craftspeople.

You can read my blog at [pketh.org](http://pketh.org), or follow me on Twitter [@pketh](http://twitter.com/pketh)

I hope you enjoy using Kinopio and find it useful,

xoxo
