Hi, my name is Pirijan and I make Kinopio,

I grew up in Canada, went to school for biology and urban design. I've worked as a waiter, cashier, and construction worker, then stumbled into being an illustrator, designer, and engineer.

Before Kinopio, I was the co-creator of [Glitch](http://pketh.org/the-first-four-years-of-glitch.html), where I designed and built its original community site and code editor.

You can read my blog at [pketh.org](http://pketh.org), or follow me on Twitter [@pketh](http://twitter.com/pketh)

I hope you enjoy using Kinopio and find it useful,

xoxo
