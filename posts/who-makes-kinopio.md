# Who Makes Kinopio?

( ゜ρ゜)ノ

Hi, my name is Pirijan and I make Kinopio.

I used to be a biologist, then a construction worker, then an urban planner. Now I'm an engineer, designer, and illustrator.

Before this, I was the co-creator, primary designer and lead frontend developer of [Glitch](https://glitch.com). But I left because I wanted to do more.

You can read my blog at [pketh.org](http://pketh.org), or follow me on Twitter [@pketh](http://twitter.com/pketh)

I hope you enjoy using Kinopio and find it useful,

xoxo
