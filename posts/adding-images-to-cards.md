You can add images to cards by pasting in an image url from elsewhere on the internet. In desktop browsers you can get the url from an image by right clicking and selecting `Copy Image Address`

On mobile, you can usually get an image url by long pressing it and selecting the copy URL command

To view the image fullsize, click the `â†’` button next to the connector

- Kinopio requires image urls to specify image file extensions like `space.com/image.jpg`.  `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, and `gif` format images are supported.

Some websites obscure their image urls to not include the file extension `space.com/maybe-an-image`. These urls will only display as links in cards.

(psst, animated gifs also work great)
