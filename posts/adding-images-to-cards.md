## Paste in an image URL

In desktop browsers you can get the URL of an image by right clicking and selecting `Copy Image Address`. On mobile, you can usually get an image URL by long pressing it and selecting the copy URL command.

Kinopio requires image URLs to specify image file extensions like `space.com/image.jpg`.  `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, and `gif` format images are supported.

Some websites obscure their image URLs to not include the file extension `space.com/maybe-an-image`. These will only display as links in cards.

## To view the image fullsize, click the `â†’` button next to the connector
