# Mobile Tips

On a touch device like a phone dragging your finger along the screen scrolls the page, just like it does in a normal website. It also paints on your space, like it does on desktop.

However because both scrolling and painting happen as you drag, this introduces an issue when trying to paint over cards and having the page scroll at the same time

To solve this, simply long-press the screen when you want to paint. This will lock screen scrolling, enabling you to precisely paint over cards and connections.
