Friends don't spy on friends. In life and in business, I endeavor to treat everyone fairly, ethically, and honestly.

- Kinopio won’t show you ads of any kind, or sell your data.
- Children, and anyone else, will be able to use Kinopio anonymously. Without an account, none of your data will be transmitted to Kinopio servers.
- To enable you to share spaces and collaborate, you'll need to create an account. Your user data and spaces will then be hosted on AWS (via Heroku).
- Server logs are stored in Timber for the purposes of debugging issues in production. These logs are deleted after 30 days.
- To enable billing for paid plans, only the user information needed to process payments will be shared with Stripe.
- No cookies are used at all. `LocalStorage` is used to save your info. Unlike cookies, other websites cannot access your Kinopio localStorage data.
- The only analytics I use are from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/). Which does not allow me to uniquely identify anyone.
- You can permanently remove your spaces, or all of your data, at anytime.
