Currently Kinopio is totally free to use. Once all the core features to support professional use have been built, billing and payments systems will be added ([Roadmap](https://kinopio.club/-kinopio-roadmap-6TRE21gchHI7alHLuwzd5)).

When that happens Kinopio will cost 4$/month to create more than 150 cards.

## Why a Subscription?

To build and maintain a service with ongoing costs that increase over time (servers etc), subscription pricing is the only economically sustainable business model to ensure that Kinopio is supported for the long-term.
