title: How Much Does Kinopio Cost? (Pricing)
tags: ['About Kinopio']

All features of Kinopio are free to use and collaborate with, up to a limit of 150 cards.

> Kinopio costs 4$/month (USD) for unlimited cards

I want the pricing to feel simple, straightforward, and obvious.

ðŸ“ˆ Cards you add will increment the card count

ðŸ“‰ Cards you remove will decrement the card count

## Why a Subscription?

To build and maintain a service with ongoing costs that increase over time (servers etc), subscription pricing is the only economically sustainable business model to ensure that Kinopio is supported for the long-term.
