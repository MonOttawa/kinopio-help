Currently Kinopio is totally free to use. Once all the basics are finished, a subscription payment system will be added.

> Eventually, Kinopio will cost 4$/month (USD) to create more than 150 cards.

ðŸ“ˆ Cards you add will increment the card count

ðŸ“‰ Cards you remove will decrement the card count

## Why a Subscription?

To build and maintain a service with ongoing costs that increase over time (servers etc), subscription pricing is the only economically sustainable business model to ensure that Kinopio is supported for the long-term.
