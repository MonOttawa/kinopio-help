Who Can See What I Make?

## If you haven't made an account

If you haven't signed up yet, then only you can see what you make regardless of privacy setting.

## If you are signed up

If you have an account, then the space privacy setting dictates who can see what. You can change space privacy from `Spaces â†’ Privacy icon`. Each setting in the privacy dialog explains who'll be able to see and edit your space.
