If you've accidentally removed/deleted a card or space, you can restore it back through `Removed`. In the `Cards` tab, you'll be able to restore or permanently remove cards that have been removed in the current space.

- A permanently removed card or space is permanently deleted from the database and cannot be restored, so be careful with that.
