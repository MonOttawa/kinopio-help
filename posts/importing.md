## Import from Exported File

You can import the JSON of exported spaces you've saved to your computer with `Spaces → Import → [JSON] Select File`

`Spaces → Import → Are.na Channel`

If this is your first time using this feature, you'll be redirected to an Are.na authentication page. Afterwards you'll be redirected back to Kinopio and are able to input a channel URL to import (eg `https://www.are.na/kinopio/kinopio-moods`).

> Because you've authenticated with Are.na, you're able to import any channel you have access to – including your own private channels, and all open or closed channels.
