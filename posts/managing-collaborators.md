# Managing Collaborators

You, or your collaborators, can view the list of space collaborators from `Share`.

You'll be able to get more info on each collaborator, or favorite them, as well as remove them from the space.

- For security reasons, when you remove a collaborator from a space the `collaborator key` for that space will be changed. This won't affect existing collaborators, but if you've sent someone an invite url that hasn't been used yet, you'll need to send them a new one.
